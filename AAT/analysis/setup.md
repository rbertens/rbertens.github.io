# Obtain the code

Our starting point for these exercises is the example analysis ‘AliAnalysisTaskMyTask.cxx’ that was covered during the lesson. Of course it wouldn’t be very efficient to copy and paste the code for your ‘empty’ analysis task from the slides of the lecture. You can use different methods to obtain it, suggested here in order of adventerousness

1. As we have learned in the previous days, programmers use version control systems for developing their code. Use what you have learned during our GIT lectures, and _clone_ the example task repository. You can find it on [https://github.com/rbertens/ALICE_analysis_tutorial](https://github.com/rbertens/ALICE_analysis_tutorial)

2. The second approach is the most robust: if you have a github account, you can make a _fork_ of the example task repository, by surfing to [https://github.com/rbertens/ALICE_analysis_tutorial](https://github.com/rbertens/ALICE_analysis_tutorial) and clicking on _fork_. If you’ve forked the repository, you can proceed to clone it on your laptop, this allows you to develop the code, and push commits to your own fork

Whichever approach you chose, the end result should be that you have stored these files on your laptop. One word of caution: _the path in which you store these files cannot contain spaces! E.g. /home/my awesome task/ will not work, use /home/my_awesome_task/ 
.


# A first look at your task

As a start, just take a look at code that makes up the task. You should see the files that were also covered in the first part of the talk:

*   AliAnalysisTaskMyTask.cxx

*   AliAnalysisTaskMyTask.h

*   AddMyTask.C

*   runAnalysis.C

Try to find where all the code snippets that were shown during the presentation fit in, and wonder if you can answer the following questions

*   which function is called for each event?

*   where are the output histogram defined?

*   where are the output histogram filled?

Remember, that for now, the name ‘AliAnalysisTaskMyTask’ doesn’t sound so bad, but when you develop a task ‘in real life’, make sure to give it a meaningful name, that explains what the task is aimed at.


# Get the data

To run this task, you will also need to download an input file **AliAOD.root**, which contains some actual reconstructed collisions. We will be looking at Pb-Pb data that was taken in 2015. 

## Source your environment
We will get the data form the ALICE file catalogue, so first, we need to make sure that we can access that. Load your ALICE environment like Dario has showed you yesterday, e.g. by doing (note that this command may look a bit different, depending on how you installed the software yesterday)

```
alienv enter AliPhysics::latest
```

You should see which module files are currently loaded, e.g.

```
  1) BASE/1.0
  2) GCC-Toolchain/v6.2.0-alice1-1
  3) AliEn-Runtime/v2-19-le-1
  4) GSL/v1.16-1
  5) Python-modules/1.0-1
  6) ROOT/v6-10-06+git_c54db1c10b-1
  7) boost/v1.59.0-1
  8) cgal/v4.6.3-1
  9) fastjet/v3.2.1_1.024-alice1-1
 10) Vc/1.3.2-1
 11) AliRoot/0742e9dc6e12c74634a1e353ab00ceba45335401_ROOT6-1
 12) AliPhysics/latest
Use alienv list to list loaded modules. Use exit to exit this environment.
```

The module Alien-Runtime is now available, which is what we will use to get our data. 

`TIP`

Did you manage to build AliPhysics yesterday? If not, please ask for help! If we for some reason do not manage to get your laptop ready, you can also do the exercises on lxplus, by first logging into lxplus

```
ssh -Y <username>@lxplus.cern.ch
```
and, once you are logged in, loading the right modules

```
/cvmfs/alice.cern.ch/bin/alienv enter VO_ALICE@AliPhysics::vAN-20171101-1
```

## Get a valid token

To authenticate yourself, obtain a token
```
alien-token-init <username>
``` 

where _username_ is your CERN username. You should be prompted to provide your PEM pass phrase, which is **not the same as your CERN password** unless you set them to be the same yourself. 


If all goes well, you will see something like
```
[AliPhysics/latest] ~/sw $> alien-token-init rbertens

Once you have obtained a valid token, enter the alice environment shell by typing
```
aliensh
```
you should see
```
[AliPhysics/latest] ~/sw $> aliensh

aliensh:[alice] [1] /alice/cern.ch/user/r/rbertens/ >
```
This shell works a lot like a normal unix shell, but it is not! Most of the commands that you have seen earlier this week are available, but not all. 


Move to the directory where the data we are looking for is stored

```
cd /alice/data/2015/LHC15o/000246757/pass1/AOD/002/
```
and copy the AliAOD.root file that is inside this folder to your ** local ** hard drive by doing
```
cp AliAOD.root file:.
```

Note the syntax of the copy command. 

## Trouble ?
If for some reason this does not work for you - no fear - ask one of the helpers, and they will provide an input file for you.
