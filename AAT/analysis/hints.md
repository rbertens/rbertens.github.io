# Some hints

To create documentation of analysis code, we use a system called ’Doxygen’. You can find explanation about Doxygen at this webpage: [https://dberzano.github.io/alice/doxygen/](https://dberzano.github.io/alice/doxygen/).

The Doxygen documentation of AliROOT and AliPhysics is available here [http://alidoc.cern.ch/](http://alidoc.cern.ch/) . It is generated daily.
